<!-- About Me -->
    <section>
      <h3 class="border-top">About Taylor</h3>
        <p>I always struggled with knowing what I would do for my career. Switching from many subjects, I was constantly looking for what would be my "spark." In high school, I had a few coding classes, remembered how much I enjoyed them and downloaded a coding app. I had finished at least three more coding games and three free courses pretty soon. I loved it! I then joined a slack coding group where I began talking to others about their journey/work, and it made me even more excited to meet future developers with who I can work together and learn. </p>
      
        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!</p>

        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I am so excited to see what web development has in store. I have always wanted to change the world through my creative and genuine hard work and passion, and now I have the opportunity to do so.</p>
